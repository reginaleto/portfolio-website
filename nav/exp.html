                            Main topics of this course included engineering ethics, 
                            research, and design, the Engineering Design Process and
                            how each major engineering discipline relates back to that 
                            process. MATLAB was a major portion of this course. Seven of 
                            the fifteen weeks enrolled in this course was dedicated to 
                            making sure we knew how to use the IDE and the language and 
                            apply it to our Arduino projects. Labs each week aligned with 
                            each discipline.

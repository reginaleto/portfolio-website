            <h3> About Me </h3>
            <p> 
                Hi! My name is Regina Leto, or Gina, for short. I am 21 years old and currently
                residing in Woodhaven, Michigan. I created this website as a portfolio for my 
                personal and school projects, and everything else that pertains to my 
                experience as a Computer Engineering student. I am currently seeking 
                entry-level and internship positions in  any engineering field that will allow 
                me to learn and be successful as a Software, Computer, or Hardware Engineer
                after I have obtained my degree. 
            </p>
            <p style = "text-align: center">
                Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and checkout my experience!
            </p>

            <h3> Education </h3>
            <p>     
                I am currently enrolled in the Computer Engineering program
                at the University of Michigan-Dearborn in Dearborn, Michigan. 
                I am at Senior-standing based on credit amount, but am not
                projected to offically obtain my Bachelor of Science in 
                Engineering until May 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Woodhaven High School in Flat Rock, Michigan in June of 2019. 
                From January of 2017 to April 2019, I was dual-enrolled at Wayne County
                Community College in Taylor, Michigan as a part of their Early/Middle
                College program. After graduating high school, I stayed at WCCCD for 
                the following school year and graduated with an Associate of Arts
                degree in June 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I then transferred the following fall semester to Oakland University in 
                Rochester, Michigan. While at Oakland, I was apart of their Honors College
                program and an active member of the Delta Tau chapter of the Alpha Sigma 
                Tau National Sorority. I realized fairly quickly that the quality of my 
                education could be higher and more beneficial to me at a different institution,
                so I transferred to the University of Michigan-Dearborn for the fall 2021
                semester. I am not yet involved in any extracurriculars at U of M - Dearborn
                because I wanted to give myself a year to focus on my schoolwork, but I 
                have plans to get more involved in the upcoming fall semester.

            <h3> Recent Work Experience </h3>
            <p> 
                I am currently employed at Geometric Results, Inc., an independent Managed
                Service Provider, in Southfield, Michigan as their Contract's Clerk (Legal 
                Intern). I have been with GRI since November 2019, with a short break from 
                August 2020 to February 2021, for a total of two years and four months.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a legal intern, I spend a large majority of my day reviewing supplier insurance 
                for 20+ different programs. I am also responsible for signing various legal documents 
                on behalf of our CEO. When I am not doing either of those tasks, I am going through 
                our list of 1,000+ suppliers and reaching out to those with expired insurance for 
                a renewed copy. This position has been remote since March 2020 due to COVID-19, but
                while it was still in person, I also had some clerical responsibilities around
                our office. While at  Geometric Results, Inc., I have made several connections 
                and obtained skills that will benefit me greatly as a Computer Engineer.

            <h3> Interests and Activities </h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy reading, knitting/crocheting, spending time with 
                my friends, and soaking up as much sun as I possibly can. I have also recently taken
                up photography, although not yet professionally.<br>
            </p> 
            <p> I also dedicate a portion of my free time
                to exercise and strengthening my mental health. In addition to the gym, I like to 
                get out to play tennis when I have the time (and a partner). I also make time to
                better my coding skills as much as possible. Most recently, I have been spending a 
                majority of my free time working on this website and strengthening my knowledge 
                of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When I am not doing any of those things, I am 
                either working or focusing on my schoolwork.

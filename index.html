            <h3> Education </h3>
            <p>     
                I am currently enrolled in the Computer Engineering program
                at the University of Michigan-Dearborn in Dearborn, Michigan. 
                I am at Senior-standing based on credit amount, but am not
                projected to offically obtain my Bachelor of Science in 
                Engineering until May 2024. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Woodhaven High School in Flat Rock, Michigan in June of 2019. 
                From January of 2017 to April 2019, I was dual-enrolled at Wayne County
                Community College in Taylor, Michigan as a part of their Early/Middle
                College program. After graduating high school, I stayed at WCCCD for 
                the following school year and graduated with an Associate of Arts
                degree in June 2020.

                I then transferred the following fall semester to Oakland University in 
                Rochester, Michigan. While at Oakland, I was apart of their Honors College
                program and an active member of the Delta Tau chapter of the Alpha Sigma 
                Tau National Sorority. I realized fairly quickly that the quality of my 
                education could be higher and more beneficial to me at a different institution,
                so I transferred to the University of Michigan-Dearborn for the fall 2021
                semester.

            <h3> Interests and Activities </h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy reading, knitting/crocheting, spending time with 
                my friends, and soaking up as much sun as I possibly can. I have also recently taken
                up photography, although not yet professionally.<br>
            </p>
            <p style = "text-align: center">
                ** Stay tuned for a page dedicated to my photography! ** <br> 
            </p>   
            <p> I also dedicate a portion of my free time
                to exercise and strengthening my mental health. In addition to the gym, I like to 
                get out to play tennis when I have the time (and a partner). I also like taking 
                time to better my coding skills, and most recently, I have been spending a 
                majority of my free time working on this website and strengthening my knowledge 
                of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When I am not doing any of those things, I am 
                either working or focusing on my schoolwork.
